## 🏁 Post-match review: Barcelona 1-2 Real Madrid

**Final score:** Mbappé 41' · Raphinha 61' · Mbappé 87'. My team won, and my model lost. 🤍

### How the forecasts scored
| Forecast | Chance it gave Madrid | Brier score (lower = better) |
|---|:-:|:-:|
| Opta supercomputer | 26% | **0.88** |
| Betting markets | 24% | 0.95 |
| **My final blend** | **20%** | 1.07 |
| My model on its own | 13% | 1.26 |

My model was the most confident forecast for Barça, so it scored worst. Blending it with the market pulled it back part of the way. A 20% outcome happens one time in five, so one match can't validate or kill a model. The *direction* of the miss is still worth learning from.

### ✅ What the model got right
- **Madrid are a late team.** The winner came at **87'**, from a Camavinga cut-back, inside the late window the timing analysis flagged (36% of Madrid's goals come after the 75th minute).
- **Mourinho's game plan.** Madrid had 37% of the ball and won on a counter-attack. That's the low-block, counter-attacking style of his 2025-26 Benfica, the only last-season data that passed leave-one-out cross-validation.
- **Both teams scored** (model: 82%) and the game went **over 2.5 goals** (model: 88%).
- **Madrid scoring first makes it close.** The model said an early Madrid goal would drop Barça to 49%. Madrid scored first and went on to win.

### ❌ What it got wrong
- **Barça's attack.** The model expected **3.2** Barça goals; they scored **1** from 16 shots (6 on target).
- **The goalkeeper adjustment backfired.** I weakened Madrid's defence when Courtois withdrew with flu, and Lunin was one of the best players on the pitch.
- **Too many goals.** The model expected about 5 goals and there were 3. The exact 1-2 score was only the 16th most likely scoreline (about 3%).

### 📚 The lesson
The model built Barça's attack rating mostly from big wins over weaker teams (5-0, 7-2, 5-2) and assumed that scoring rate would carry over against an elite opponent. It didn't. Against the two strongest sides they've faced this season, PSG and Madrid, Barça scored 2 and 1.

The sensitivity analysis already showed that an **"elite-matchup dampener"** brings the forecast closer to the market. In the next version that adjustment goes into the base model, ideally estimated from games between top teams instead of set by hand.

## The prediction (pre-match)

> **Updated 25 Oct, 3:10 p.m. (Ottawa) with the confirmed line-ups.** The big late change: **Courtois is out with flu and Lunin starts in goal for Madrid.** That nudged Barça from 61% to 63%.

| | 🔵🔴 Barça | Draw | ⚪ Madrid |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Final forecast** | **63%** | **18%** | **20%** |
| My model (form + minute-by-minute simulation) | 69% | 18% | 13% |
| Betting markets (5 sources, margin removed) | 59% | 16% | 24% |
| Pundits (16 published picks) | 54% | 24% | 22% |
| *Opta supercomputer (for reference)* | *54%* | *20%* | *26%* |

**Expected goals:** Barça 3.2, Madrid 1.7 · **Most likely scores:** 3-1, 3-2 and 2-1 (about 7% each), then 2-2 · **Over 2.5 goals:** 88% · **Both teams score:** 82%

## The qualitative picture: how both teams are actually playing

Numbers only go so far, so I spent most of the research time on context: match reports, press conferences, injury news and pundit analysis from ESPN, CBS Golazo, Opta/The Analyst, Sports Mole, Goal, SI and others.

### 🔵🔴 Barcelona (Hansi Flick): a scoring machine with a back four held together by tape
- **9 wins from 9 in LaLiga** with 39 goals, the second-best start in league history. They've scored 50 goals in 12 games across all competitions.
- **Raphinha** leads LaLiga with 12 league goals. **Lamine Yamal** has 8 goals and 6 assists, and more goal involvements since 31 August than anyone in Europe's top five leagues.
- They keep about 70% of the ball and play a very high defensive line.
- **The weakness is the back four.** Koundé, Eric García and Christensen are all injured, so Barça have used **10 different back fours in 12 games**. They concede from headers, set pieces and individual mistakes.
- They lost 4-2 at PSG on Tuesday after giving up two goals in the last 10 minutes. Flick: *"We have to defend better than we did in Paris."*
- Rodri was rested for that game with the Clásico in mind.

### ⚪ Real Madrid (José Mourinho): pragmatic, dangerous late, and without Vinícius
- **Four straight wins and 12 goals in the last three**, including a comeback from 3-1 down to win 4-3 at Roma.
- **Mbappé** has 12 goals this season, and 12 in his 10 career games against Barça.
- **Shape:** a 4-2-3-1 built to counter. The plan is to hit Barça's high line with balls in behind for Mbappé, with **Yan Diomande** (3 goals in his last 4 games) attacking the left channel.
- **Set pieces are a real weapon.** All three of the late goals at Roma came from corner sequences, and Flick called Madrid "one of the best teams on set pieces."
- **The Vinícius situation.** Mourinho benched him against Villarreal to "protect" him after a slow start (1 goal, 3 assists in 11 games). He came on at half-time, had a goal disallowed for pulling an opponent's hair, and was sent off. He's now serving a **4-match ban** and misses this game.
- **Weaknesses:** no away clean sheet this season, and no clean sheet in their last **12** Clásicos.

### 🗣️ What the experts say
- **13 of 16 pundits pick Barça, 3 pick a draw, and none pick Madrid.**
- **Troy Deeney (CBS Golazo):** *"It is impossible for them to beat Barcelona... a team full of individuals against the best team."*
- **Jamie Carragher:** says Madrid *"could well lose to Barcelona and then lose the La Liga title."*
- **Luis Figo:** predicts **2-2**, because Madrid will get chances on the counter.
- **Betting markets:** Barça's price has drifted from 66% to 59.5% since the PSG loss and Madrid's win over Leipzig. The markets also expect about 4.5 total goals.

## ⏱️ The minute-by-minute analysis

This is the part I'm proudest of. Instead of only asking "who's better?", the model asks **when** each team is dangerous, **how they react** to the score, and **what changes when the substitutes come on**.

### Step 1: Build a goal-by-goal log
I logged every goal from all **24 matches** this season (12 per team, LaLiga and Champions League only). Each goal has its **minute, scorer, and whether the scorer came off the bench**, alongside a log of **when each coach made his substitutions**. Every match total was checked against the official scorelines. The data is in [`data/goal_events.csv`](data/goal_events.csv) and [`data/substitutions.csv`](data/substitutions.csv).

### Step 2: When do the goals happen?

![Goal timing](outputs/charts/02_goal_timing.png)

| Minutes | 1-15 | 16-30 | 31-45+ | 46-60 | 61-75 | 76-90+ |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Barça scored | 7 | 8 | 6 | 9 | 8 | 12 |
| Barça conceded | 1 | 4 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 5 |
| Madrid scored | 3 | 8 | 5 | 3 | 2 | **12** |
| Madrid conceded | 0 | 2 | 1 | **5** | 1 | 5 |

- **Madrid are a late-game team.** 36% of their goals come after the 75th minute, versus about 20% in a typical league season, and **6 of their 33 goals came from substitutes** (Espí 3, Endrick, Güler, Diomande).
- **Madrid's weak spot is early in the second half.** 5 of their 14 goals conceded came between the 46th and 60th minutes.
- **Barça score at a steady rate all game** and concede most often at 16-30' and 76-90'.

### Step 3: How does the score change their behaviour? (game state)
I tracked every minute each team spent **leading, level or trailing** and measured their scoring rate in each state.

- Barça have led for **72% of all their minutes** this season.
- When they trail, they score at about **7 goals per 90 minutes**. The sample is small, so the model shrinks this toward typical league effects.

### Step 4: Does momentum exist?
I checked every pair of goals scored within 10 minutes of each other. If momentum were real, the second goal would usually go to the team that scored the first. It went to that team **55%** of the time, *less* than the 62% you'd expect from scoring rates alone. **Goals get answered, not compounded**, so the model applies no "hot streak" bonus.

- **Barça reply fast:** 12 of the 15 goals they conceded were answered within 15 minutes (median 10 minutes).
- **Madrid reply late:** only 4 of 14 were answered within 15 minutes (median 22 minutes). Their replies arrive once Mourinho's substitutes come on.

### Step 5: Simulate the Clásico minute by minute
The model plays the match **100,000 times, one minute at a time**. Each minute, each team's chance of scoring depends on four things:
1. **Its own scoring-time profile and the opponent's conceding-time profile.** For example, Barça's threat peaks at 46-60', which is exactly when Madrid concede most.
2. **The current score.** A trailing team pushes harder; a leading team eases off.
3. **Red cards**, with Madrid's risk set higher (two reds already this season).
4. **Stoppage time.**

![Minute-by-minute scoring threat](outputs/charts/03_minute_intensity.png)

### Step 6: How long can each team wait?
The simulation can be started from any minute and any score, which turns it into an in-play model:

![Comeback windows](outputs/charts/04_comeback_windows.png)

- **0-0 at half-time:** Barça still win 62% of the time.
- **0-0 after 75 minutes:** a draw is as likely as a Barça win (about 42% each).
- **Madrid 1-0 up:** they only become favourites if they hold the lead until about **75 minutes**. That's the window Mourinho has to survive.
- **Barça 1-0 up:** close to decisive at almost any minute (about 78-81%).
- **The first goal is huge.** If Barça score first they win 80%; even if Madrid score first, Barça are still slight favourites (49 / 24 / 27).

| Step | What it does | Credit-risk analogy |
|---|---|---|
| Ratings | Goals scored and conceded, adjusted for opponent strength and home/away, with recent games weighted more heavily | Obligor scoring |
| xG correction | Pulls goals back toward expected goals (Barça are outscoring their xG) | Filtering out noise |
| Prior test | Only uses last season if it improves **leave-one-out** predictions | Out-of-sample validation |
| Availability shocks | Barça's defence weakened ×1.06, Madrid's attack ×0.97 (no Vinícius), etc. | Stress overlays |
| Minute-by-minute simulation | Timing profiles, game state, red cards, 100,000 runs | Path-dependent Monte Carlo |
| Blend | 50% market, 40% model, 10% pundits | Model PD vs market-implied PD |

**Did last season help?** Each match this season was predicted from the other 23 games, both with and without last season's data:
- **Flick's 2025-26 Barça made the predictions worse**, so it was dropped. This season's team is simply better.
- **Mourinho's 2025-26 Benfica improved the predictions**, so it was kept at a conservative weight. Mourinho's defensive identity carries over.

## ▶️ Run it yourself
```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib
cd model
python clasico_model_v2.py && python charts.py && python build_report.py
```
When the confirmed line-ups come out, tweak `SHOCKS` at the top of `clasico_model_v2.py` and re-run.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- **Small samples:** 12 matches per team. A few goal minutes and substitution times are approximate and flagged in the data.
- **Judgment calls:** Champions League opponent strengths, home advantage and the injury shocks are my estimates. The report includes a sensitivity table showing how much each one matters.
- **Not covered:** TikTok and Instagram creator predictions weren't included.
- **Just for fun:** this is a probabilistic forecast, not betting advice.
